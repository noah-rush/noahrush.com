Philly Zing

Philly Zing was the first web development project I worked on. The idea for the app was a theater review site for shows during the 2014 Philadelphia Fringe Festival. Unfortunately the site has not been maintained, but it was designed and built by me using Flask, and it gave me the ability to experiment with all kinds of new features. At its core the app scraped theater calendars to aggregate show data, including dates, information and venue. Users could then log in and review shows, either writing reviews or rating it with stars like on yelp. Users had to authenticate using a email and password, or with facebook. Users could also give shows adjective descriptors, like "funny" or "sad" or "abysmal", and then other users could sort the shows based on those descriptors. I also scraped local review sites to add professional reviews to the show descriptions. Basically, think Rotten Tomatoes except localized to Philadelphia and for theatre. This project gave me an opportunity to experiment and learn many new technologies, among them flask, API calls in jquery, html, css, Postgres and Heroku.
